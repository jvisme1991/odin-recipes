# odin-recipes

This project is based on building a recipe website using HTML. I will have implemented a basic boiler plate template, <main> and <body> sytaxs, and links to recipes. Along the way, I will use "git add" and "git commits" with comments to keep track of the project, while also keeping notes of changes made along the way.
