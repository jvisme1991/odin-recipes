            My version of this classic Thai dish has spectacular taste even with regular basil instead of Thai or holy basil. The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.

          "I don't cook Thai food at home often, mostly because there are at least a dozen such restaurants within walking distance, but when I do, there's nothing I enjoy more than this spicy Thai basil chicken," says Chef John.
